### Intro to CS with Processing FINAL PROJECT
## Chaaranath Badrinath
# Rye Country Day School
This project was my final project for my Intro to Computer Science class at RCDS, where I made the game "Swing Shot". In this game, a player controls a ball swinging 
between poles with semi-realistic swinging physics and acceleration. The objective of the game is to attach to the most poles as possible without going offscreen.
This game was coded in the Python learning IDE Processing, and the graphics were made using Processing's inbuilt GUI capabilities. The game overall took around 2-3 weeks
to develop.

Enjoy!
